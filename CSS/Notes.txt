What is CSS?
Ans. CSS stands for cascading style sheet
CSS is used to design HTML tags
CSS is a widely used language on the web.

CSS Syntax  selector p{color:black}

CSS Syntax

Selector: Selector indicates the HTML element you want to style. It could be any tag like <h1>, <title>
Declaration Block: The declaration block can contain one or more declaration separated by a semicolon

Property: A property is a type of attribute of HTML element. It could be color,border etc.
value: Values are assigned to CSS property. In the above example, value "yellow" is assigned to color property

    color:white;
    padding:5px;
}

</style>

CSS Selector
CSS Selector are used to select the content you want to style.
Selector are the part of CSS rule set. CSS selecor select HTML elements according to its id, class, type, attribute etc
Types of CSS Selector
CSS Universal selector
CSS Element Selector
Css Id selector 
Css Class Selector
Css Group selector
Css Descendant selector

CSS Universal Selector

The universal selector is used as a wildcard character. It selects all the elements on the pages

Syntax:
<style>
*{
    color:green;
    font-size:20px;
}

CSS Element Selector
The element selector selects the HTML elements by name
Syntax:
<style> p{
    text-align:center;
    color:blue;
}
</style>


CSS id selector
The id selector selects the id attribute of an HTML elements to select a specific element. An id is alwaysunique within
the page so it us chosen to select a single unique element 
It is written with the hash character(#)

Syntax
#para1{
    text-align:
    center:color:
    blue;

}

CSS Class selector for specificelemts 
if you want to specify that only specific HTML elements should be affected then you should use the elements name 
with class selector
syntax:
<style>
p.center{
    text-align:
    center;color:
    blue;
}
</style>
<p class="center"> this paragraph is blue and center - aligned.</p>

CSS Group Selector
The grouping selector is used to select all the elemensts with the same style Definition
Grouping selector is used to minimize the code. commas are used to separate each selector in grouping 
h1,h2,p
{
    text-align:center;color:
    blue;
}
CSS Combinators 
CSS Text Transform 
This CSS property allows us to change the case of the text. It is used to control the 
text capitalization. This CSS property can be used to make the appearanc of text in all-lowercase or all-uppercase or can convert the
first character of each word to each word to uppercase 

Syntax 
Text-transform: capitalizel| uppercase| lowercase |none| initial| inherit;

CSS Font Variant 
CSS font variant property specifies how to set font variant of an element. It may
be normal and small - caps

CSS Font Weight
CSS font weight property defines the weight of the font and specify that how bold a font
is. The possible values of font weight may be normal, bold, bolder, lighter or number 

CSS font Stretch
The font-stretch property in CSS allows us to select a normal, expanded, or condensed face
from the font's family. This property sets the text wide or narrower compare to the default
width of the font.It will not work on any font but only works on the font-family
that has a width-variant face.


CSS Background
CSS background property is used to define the background effects on element. There are 
5 CSS background properties that affects the HTML elements:
1. background-color
2. background-image
3. background-repeat
4 background-attachment
5. background-position

Background color
The backgtound-color property is used to specify the background color of the element

Background image
The background-image property is used to set an image as a background of an element
. By default the image covers the entire element

CSS background - repeat
by default the background image property repeats the background image horizontally
and vertically . Some images are repeated only horizontally or vertically 
 
 CSS background attachment
 The background attachment property is used to specify if the background image is 
 fixed or scroll with the rest of the page in browser window. if you set fixedthe 
 background image then the image will not move during scrolling in the browser 

 CSS background position 
 The background position property is used to define the initial position of the 
 background image . By default the background image is placed on the top - left 
 of the webpage. You can set the position as center top bottom left right 

CSS border 
The CSS border is a shorthand property used to set the border on an element 
The CSS border properties are used to specify the style, color and size of the 
border 

CSS Gradient 
CSS linear Gradient 
CSS gradients let you display smooth transitions between two or more specified colors.

CSS defines three types of gradients:

Linear Gradients (goes down/up/left/right/diagonally)
Radial Gradients (defined by their center)
Conic Gradients (rotated around a center point)

CSS Linear Gradients
To create a linear gradient you must define at least two color stops. Color stops are the colors you want to render smooth transitions among. You can also set a starting point and a direction (or an angle) along with the gradient effect.

Syntax
background-image: linear-gradient(direction, color-stop1, color-stop2, ...);

CSS Radial Gradients
A radial gradient is defined by its center.

To create a radial gradient you must also define at least two color stops.

Syntax
background-image: radial-gradient(shape size at position, start-color, ..., last-color);

CSS Conic Gradients
A conic gradient is a gradient with color transitions rotated around a center point.

To create a conic gradient you must define at least two colors.

Syntax
background-image: conic-gradient([from angle] [at position,] color [degree], color [degree], ...);

CSS RGB Colors
An RGB color value represents RED, GREEN, and BLUE light sources.

RGB Value
In CSS, a color can be specified as an RGB value, using this formula:

rgb(red, green, blue)

Each parameter (red, green, and blue) defines the intensity of the color between 0 and 255.

For example, rgb(255, 0, 0) is displayed as red, because red is set to its highest value (255) and the others are set to 0.

To display black, set all color parameters to 0, like this: rgb(0, 0, 0).

To display white, set all color parameters to 255, like this: rgb(255, 255, 255).

RGBA Value
RGBA color values are an extension of RGB color values with an alpha channel - which specifies the opacity for a color.

An RGBA color value is specified with:

rgba(red, green, blue, alpha)

The alpha parameter is a number between 0.0 (fully transparent) and 1.0 (not transparent at all):
CSS HEX Colors

A hexadecimal color is specified with: #RRGGBB, where the RR (red), GG (green) and BB (blue) hexadecimal integers specify the components of the color.

HEX Value
In CSS, a color can be specified using a hexadecimal value in the form:

#rrggbb

Where rr (red), gg (green) and bb (blue) are hexadecimal values between 00 and ff (same as decimal 0-255).

For example, #ff0000 is displayed as red, because red is set to its highest value (ff) and the others are set to the lowest value (00).

To display black, set all values to 00, like this: #000000.

To display white, set all values to ff, like this: #ffffff.  
Digit HEX Value
Sometimes you will see a 3-digit hex code in the CSS source.

The 3-digit hex code is a shorthand for some 6-digit hex codes.

The 3-digit hex code has the following form:

#rgb

Where r, g, and b represent the red, green, and blue components with values between 0 and f.

The 3-digit hex code can only be used when both the values (RR, GG, and BB) are the same for each component. So, if we have #ff00cc, it can be written like this: #f0c.
CSS HSL Colors
HSL Value
In CSS, a color can be specified using hue, saturation, and lightness (HSL) in the form:

hsl(hue, saturation, lightness)

Hue is a degree on the color wheel from 0 to 360. 0 is red, 120 is green, and 240 is blue.

Saturation is a percentage value. 0% means a shade of gray, and 100% is the full color.

Lightness is also a percentage. 0% is black, 50% is neither light or dark, 100% is white

CSS Colors
Colors in CSS can be specified by the following methods:

Hexadecimal colors
Hexadecimal colors with transparency
RGB colors
RGBA colors
HSL colors
HSLA colors
Predefined/Cross-browser color names
With the currentcolor keyword
Hexadecimal Colors
A hexadecimal color is specified with: #RRGGBB, where the RR (red), GG (green) and BB (blue) hexadecimal integers specify the components of the color. All values must be between 00 and FF.

For example, the #0000ff value is rendered as blue, because the blue component is set to its highest value (ff) and the others are set to 00.
Hexadecimal Colors With Transparency
A hexadecimal color is specified with: #RRGGBB. To add transparency, add two additional digits between 00 and FF.

RGB Colors
An RGB color value is specified with the rgb() function, which has the following syntax:

rgb(red, green, blue)

Each parameter (red, green, and blue) defines the intensity of the color and can be an integer between 0 and 255 or a percentage value (from 0% to 100%).

For example, the rgb(0,0,255) value is rendered as blue, because the blue parameter is set to its highest value (255) and the others are set to 0.

Also, the following values define equal color: rgb(0,0,255) and rgb(0%,0%,100%).
RGBA Colors
RGBA color values are an extension of RGB color values with an alpha channel - which specifies the opacity of the object.

An RGBA color is specified with the rgba() function, which has the following syntax:

rgba(red, green, blue, alpha)

The alpha parameter is a number between 0.0 (fully transparent) and 1.0 (fully opaque)
HSL Colors
HSL stands for hue, saturation, and lightness - and represents a cylindrical-coordinate representation of colors.

An HSL color value is specified with the hsl() function, which has the following syntax:

hsl(hue, saturation, lightness)

Hue is a degree on the color wheel (from 0 to 360) - 0 (or 360) is red, 120 is green, 240 is blue. Saturation is a percentage value; 0% means a shade of gray and 100% is the full color. Lightness is also a percentage; 0% is black, 100% is white.
HSLA Colors
HSLA color values are an extension of HSL color values with an alpha channel - which specifies the opacity of the object.

An HSLA color value is specified with the hsla() function, which has the following syntax:

hsla(hue, saturation, lightness, alpha)

The alpha parameter is a number between 0.0 (fully transparent) and 1.0 (fully opaque).
